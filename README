### Supported Platforms ###
- Linux 64 Bit with
- Nvidia OpenCL SDK (GPU) or
- AMD OpenCL SDK (CPU and GPU)

### Installation ###
Download and install Nvidia or AMD OpenCL SDK and make sure the examples run without errors.
Download the Zeta AMD or Nvidia Version from github. 
The AMD package is also capable of running on CPUs (>=SSE3). 
It will autodetect if a AMD GPU is present, otherwise the CPU is used.

Place the Zeta folder in your SDK samples Folder and run make.

### Configuration ###
In the File config.h you can modifiy the factor "threadsX".
Zeta runs by default 20 * 128 threads. This Configuration needs about 256 MegaBytes of RAM.
Make sure that "threadsX * 12,5 MB" does not exceed the memory available (typical 1/4 of your physical GPU memory).

### Play ###
You need Xboard or another Winboard compatible Suite to run the Zeta Chess Engine.
