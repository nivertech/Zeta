the xboard command could look like:
xboard -fcp /home/srdja/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/OpenCL/bin/linux/release/zeta_nvidia -fd /home/srdja/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/OpenCL/src/Zeta/ -depth 4
or
xboard -fcp /home/srdja/apps/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx64/samples/opencl/bin/x86_64/zeta_amd -fd /home/srdja/apps/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx64/samples/opencl/bin/x86_64/ -depth 4
